# Course Project - week 3

As part of the Getting and Cleaning Data course, this readme file will describe all the files and objectives of the course projedct. 

## The r script run_analysis.R will do the following: 

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## The Data

The r script will utilize the data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The r script will use the 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder as its working directory that you can get from the downloaded zip file called 'getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset'

## This Repo contains 3 files that describes and completes the objectives of this course project

1. README.md
    this file summarizes the objectives of the project
2. CodebBook.md
    this file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data 
3. run_analysis.R
    this file contains the code to create the new tidy data set following the steps above.
